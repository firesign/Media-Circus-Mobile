Media-Circus-Mobile
===================

Media Circus Web App is a scrolling, internet-enabled marquee that displays amusing news headlines. There is one Arduino-powered hardware version in the lobby of the Design Offices on the second floor of the North Block, NSCAD (http://w3w.co/stewed.bagel.sang).
It uses #generalxcentric's daily tweets, which are cutups of contemporary news headlines from the CBC and the Toronto Globe and Mail.	
A book featuring 365 tweets from General Eccentric in 2012 is available at Blurb.com (http://www.blurb.ca/b/4280789-media-circus).
